# Sean Higgins's academic website

This repository contains source code for my academic website, www.seankhiggins.com.

The website was created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). 
Some useful resources:
	- Jekyll tutorial https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/. 
	- Linking to a custom domain name is explained at https://www.curtismlarson.com/blog/2015/04/12/github-pages-google-domains/.
	- Setting up https for your custom domain: https://blog.github.com/2018-05-01-github-pages-custom-domains-https/
	
The theme is modified off of academic and portfolio themes, specifically the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) theme which in turn was modified off of the [\*folio](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) theme.
