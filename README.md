# Sean Higgins's website

This website was created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). 
I found this Jekyll tutorial particularly useful: <https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/>
The theme is modified off of the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) theme which in turn was modified off of the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) theme.

## License

Code for the Jekyll theme (all `.md`, `.html`, `.scss` files) is MIT license. This license applies to all code, but not to published papers or photos included in this repository.
